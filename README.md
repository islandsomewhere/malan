# malan: MAle Lineage ANlysis

MAle Lineage ANlysis by simulating genealogies backwards and 
imposing short tandem repeats (STR) mutations forwards. 
Intended for forensic Y chromosomal STR (Y-STR) haplotype analyses. 
Numerous analyses are possible, e.g. number of matches and meiotic distance to matches.

See vignettes and manual at <https://mikldk.github.io/malan/> for documentation.
